        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">First off, I would love to say three facts about me so you can make the judgement about my character instead of me blatantly telling you who I am right off the bat. For one, I love mangoes, always have and always will. If I were to die, let it be by a falling mango from a mango tree, so even in death I can say I was struck and touched by love. Second, I believe that in life and in love, thereâ€™s no going back. To be spontaneous is the equivalent of being fierce, and I do enjoy the fire it brings. But I do not invalidate the quiet moments life brings me, for it keeps me in tune with my sanity. Lastly, I am a skepticist hidden in a realist, who dreams of being an optimist. I would tell you what that means, but I grew up loving mysteries. Now that you have made your judgments, I would like to say hello and welcome to the bio that is supposed to explain me in 500 words, but we all know that is impossible. Though this makes me feel compartmentalized and limited, I do love a challenge. So here are more answers about myself that do not have a particular question attached, just mindless streams of consciousness coming at you.<br><br>

         I grew up in sunny Los Angeles, home of the Lakers, horrible traffic, and food trends that make so much sense and not at the same time. I come from a home where hard work and ambition are cultivated and translated into encouragement and opportunity. If you are my family reading this, just know that you are loved deeply by me. I attend UC Riverside, a place that has become my gateway in  reinventing myself and gaining a new perspective of what it means to be transported. Psychology is what I am studying, for I love how the brain works and how different emotions can vary between person to person. It is like getting to read minds without wishing to, it just happens. I think that is particularly beautiful in all of its entirety, putting someoneâ€™s thoughts together when they did not even know they had them. What can I say, I like to fix people. But sometimes fixing people can come at a cost, so I remind myself daily to be selfish because I am who I attract, simple as that.<br><br>

         I am nineteen years old, who still has a lot of learning and growing to do, despite all the things I do already know. This then creates a never ending continuum of me not being satisfied, since I am always in competition with myself. I think love is a beautiful thing. Complicated, yet simple. Vulnerable, yet hidden. Devoted, yet spontaneous. Perhaps it is just a paradox of itself, in that it is a thing that will always lack but fill in what is missing. As you can see, my mind wanders, ponders, and questions every little thing. Still donâ€™t get it? That is okay, thereâ€™s plenty of me to discover.
